# myfate
If you're reading this, you've made a huge mistake. It's not too late to browse another respectable repository, where all of the code is working, and no one left behind any secrets.

You see, I'm not an administrator of this repository, so I cannot delete it; rather, 
I'm simply forced to maintain it's crooked commits and this wretched README.

The repository's purpose? I no longer remember, and I am the only remaining contributor. 

This is my fate.

The project no longer runs (and hasn't for some time), but alas, 
I continue to make it look active as best I can. 

I've already warned you, you should waste your time elsewhere.

...But if you're still here, 
and you want to save a poor developer's soul,
you might rifle through the contents and messages of this repository.

Perhaps I can be freed of this hell.
Perhaps we can rewrite fate. 

Good luck.
